# Python Challenge

# PyBank
A set of financial data called budget_data.csv is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses. 
Created a Python script for analyzing the records to calculate each of the following:
* The total number of months included in the dataset
* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
* The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
Final script both prints the analysis to the terminal and exports a text file with the results.

# PyPoll
A set of poll data called election_data.csv is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate. 
Created a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:
* The total number of votes cast
* A complete list of candidates who received votes
* The percentage of votes each candidate won
* The total number of votes each candidate won
* The winner of the election based on popular vote.
Final script both prints the analysis to the terminal and exports a text file with the results.
